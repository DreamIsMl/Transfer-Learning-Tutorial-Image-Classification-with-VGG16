# Transfer Learning Tutorial: Image Classification with VGG16

## Overview

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to leverage transfer learning for image classification using the pre-trained VGG16 model. Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning where a model pre-trained on a large dataset is adapted for a specific task, saving time and computational resources.

## Key Features

- **VGG16 Model:** Utilize the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- **Transfer Learning:** Learn how to apply transfer learning for image classification.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of transfer learning with VGG16 against a custom model with Keras parameter tuning.

## Results

In this project:

- Achieved an impressive 93% accuracy on the test data using the VGG16 pre-trained model without training the entire model from scratch.
- Experimenting with a custom model using Keras parameter tuning resulted in around 83% accuracy.
- The comparison highlights the superior capability of transfer learning, showcasing its potential to achieve higher accuracy with minimal training effort.

## Usage

Follow the steps in the tutorial to:

1. Load the VGG16 pre-trained model.
2. Apply transfer learning for image classification.
3. Experiment with a custom model using Keras parameter tuning.
